# Pokédex

Sandbox for learning [Vite + react-ts](https://vitejs.dev) using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) as data source

## TODO

- [ ] Improve search home page
- [ ] Page per Pokémon
- [ ] Toggle for shinies, multi-select for generations
- [ ] Type responses

## Nice to have

- [ ] Custom CSS instead of Bootstrap so I actually learn CSS
- [x] GitHub Actions
- [x] Might be able to host it on GitHub pages, would be cool

## Ideas

- [ ] Who's that Pokemon page, grey out images and let user guess
