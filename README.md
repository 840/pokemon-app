# Pokédex

[![Build](https://github.com/840/pokemon-app/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/840/pokemon-app/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

Sandbox for learning [Vite + react-ts](https://vitejs.dev) using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) as data source

## TODO

- [ ] Improve search home page
- [ ] Page per Pokémon
- [ ] Toggle for shinies, multi-select for generations
- [x] Type responses

## Nice to have

- [ ] Custom CSS instead of Bootstrap so I actually learn CSS
- [x] GitHub Actions
- [x] Might be able to host it on GitHub pages, would be cool

## Ideas

- [x] Who's that Pokemon page, grey out images and let user guess
